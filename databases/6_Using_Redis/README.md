# Exercise: Using Redis

In this exercise, we will use Redis instead of building our own KV store. 

## Objective

- Use the same data as before: `../data/weather_3000.json`
- Write a python script to load this data into redis
- Add your script to the docker-container
- Running `docker-compose up` should populate redis with your data
- Start a redis-cli and verify your result
